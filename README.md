/*************************************************************************************************************************/

CPP file notes:

change.cpp and amount.txt fullfil question 5 of the homework.

change.cpp is a program that looks for the minimum change that can be used to make a specified amount.

changeTime.cpp and changeTime.txt fullfill question 6 of the homework

changeTime.cpp times how long it take to find the minimum change, when n and A are both changing. 

/************************************************************************************************************************/

CPP compile notes and running notes

All of th CPP files like so:

g++ change.cpp /* after running the program the output file will be "change.txt" */

g++ changeTime.cpp /* after running the program the output file will be "changeTime.txt" */

/*************************************************************************************************************************/

Format of the tables in mergeTime.out and insertTime.out

| n size | trial 1 time (mS) | trial 2 time (mS) | trial 3 time (mS) | Average time (mS) |

this format will be true for both mergeTime.out and insertTime.out, the n sizes that will be output range from 500 - 7500 on increments of 500 everytime.

/**************************************************************************************************************************/

Note: Since the n sizes are rather big for the stooge sort algorithm in stoogeTime.cpp the the program will take a some time to run. The reason that I used the larger n sizes is because they show the relationship between n size and runtime very well on the graphs.
