# AOA-HW2

In this zip there will be:

stoogesort.cpp

stoogeTime.cpp

README.md

/*************************************************************************************************************************/

CPP file notes:

stoogesort.cpp and stoogeTime.cpp fullfil question 5 of the homework.

stoogesort.cpp is a program that uses the stooge sort alogritm to sort an array into ascending order.

stoogeTime.cpp is a program that captures the runtime of the stooge sort algorithm based on n sizes ranging from 500-7500

CPP compile notes and running notes

All of th CPP files like so:

g++ insertsort.cpp /* after running the program the output file will be "insert.out" */

g++ mergesort.cpp /* after running the program the output file will be "merge.out" */

g++ insertTime.cpp /* after running the program the output will be on the console/terminal and file "insertTime.txt" */

g++ mergeTime.cpp /* after running the program the output will be on the console/terminal and file "mergeTime.txt" */

g++ merge_best_worst.cpp

g++ insert_best_worst.cpp

/*************************************************************************************************************************/

Format of the tables in mergeTime.out and insertTime.out

| n size | trial 1 time (mS) | trial 2 time (mS) | trial 3 time (mS) | Average time (mS) |

this format will be true for both mergeTime.out and insertTime.out, the n sizes that will be output range from 5000 - 70000 on increments of 5000 everytime.

As for the tables created from merge_best_worst.cpp and insert_best_worst.cpp that formatting is:

| Case Condition | trial 1 time (mS) | trial 2 time (mS) | trial 3 time (mS) | Average time (mS) |

Text files

The two text files that are include in the zip are mergeTime.txt and insertTime.cpp, these are the runtime tables for the merge sort and insertion sort alogrithms, respectivley. These tables are also included in the written portion of homework 1.
